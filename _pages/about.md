Hello! My name is Laura, and I am currently a Master's Student in Electrical Engineering in the [Postgraduate Program of Electrical Engineering](http://www.posgrad.feelt.ufu.br/) at the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia. 
I have a bachelor's degree in Control and Automation Engineering from the same university, in Brazil. Well, currently, my research area is SLAM with drone ([Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/)) in an indoor environment, applied to Industry 4.0. 

And I'm interested in research opportunities in control systems, drones, robotics, and related fields.

This site is (very much) under development. I don't know if anyone will be curious, but in general, I'll try to keep it updated with some information(?).
I like to write, so here I'll also try to write a little about things in the STEM field (in my way). 
Like a blog? Maybe. 
My academic life and the skills that came with it will also be here.

That's it for now. Thank you. See you soon!
