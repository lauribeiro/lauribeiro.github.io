Hello! My name is Laura, and I am currently a Master's Student in Electrical Engineering in the [Postgraduate Program of Electrical Engineering](http://www.posgrad.feelt.ufu.br/) at the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia. I have a bachelor's degree in Control and Automation Engineering from the same university. Well, currently, my research area is SLAM with drones in an indoor environment, applied to Industry 4.0. 

This site is (very much) under development. I don't know if anyone will be curious, but in general, I'll try to keep it updated with some information(?).
I like to write, so here I'll also try to write a little about things in the STEM field (in my own way). Like a blog? Maybe. 
My academic life and the skills that came with it will also be here.
That's it for now.

Thank you. See you soon! 

Oh, yes. I almost forgot. I'm searching for a Ph.D. opportunity in control systems, drones, robotics, and (or) related fields.
